# Path Finding Visual
An aggregation of various pathfinding algorithms visualized in Python

![example](https://github.com/dgodfrey95/path-finding-visual/blob/main/src/dijkstra.gif)

These projects use [Pygame](https://web.archive.org/web/20220223214213/https://www.pygame.org/docs/) for the animation. 

    pip install pygame
    git clone https://github.com/dgodfrey95/path-finding-visual.git

    cd *algorithm_directory*
    python *algorithm.py*
    
# Overview

The goal of these programs is to teach myself how these pathfinding algorithms work. The program starts at a random position in a 30x30 grid and it tries to find its way to another random goal position on the grid. When the path has been found it becomes illustrated on the board. The user has the option of restarting the program with their own start and goal positions.
    
# My Thoughts

By implementing these algorithms and illustrating them I have a deeper understanding of how they work as well as their possible applications. Graph theory has become more accessible to me through doing these projects.

This was also my first introduction to Pygame. I was very impressed by how easy it was to get used to.
